### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a fullstack developer on a company called PULSE, working with React and JQuery for the frontend, and some projects using React Native, from the figma prototype to the real application, consuming REST APIs and using git to keep the project updated, also testing the components with Jest and dockerizing the project. For the backend I mostly use Java Spring Boot Framework, but there's a few NodeJS projects.
